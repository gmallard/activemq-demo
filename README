This project contains Java code which uses JMS messaging, and which has been
tested with Active MQ versions:

- 5.0.0
- 5.2.0

Note:  this is an Eclipse project.  However, the Java JAR files required to 
compile and run this code are not provided here.  See the '.classpath' file
in this directory to understand what JAR files are required.  Setting this
up properly will require modifications to the project's properties, specifically
the build path.  The basic requirement for this are:

- Apache's LOG4J
- Apache's Active MQ

Enjoy.
